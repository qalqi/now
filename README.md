Initiative for Universal Multilingual Development: Frameworks, Tools and Apps

Description:
In an increasingly globalized world, establishing a digital presence is imperative for individuals and businesses alike. However, language barriers often pose significant obstacles, limiting access to the immense opportunities presented by web and mobile app development. The "Now: Enabling Universal Multilingual Development" project is dedicated to dismantling these barriers and ensuring web and mobile app development is accessible to speakers of all languages.

Our vision is to empower individuals and businesses across the globe to construct websites, mobile apps, and e-commerce platforms in their native languages. "Now" is an initiative aimed at offering programming languages to accommodate a wide array of languages, including Telugu, Bahasa, Hindi, Korean, and many more. We firmly believe that training 6.5 billion to 7 billion people to teach English and programming is a more challenging engineering and design problem than internationalizing (i18ning) programming languages. Whether you're a small business owner in Nepali-speaking regions or an aspiring app developer in Chinese-speaking areas, "Now" welcomes you to establish your digital presence using the language you are most comfortable with.

This project not only facilitates language-inclusive digital development but also champions cultural diversity on the web, fostering a more enriched and inclusive online experience. Embrace the "Now" initiative and unlock the full potential of the digital world in your preferred language!
